# Number of Ways To Traverse A Matrix
[Number of Ways To Traverse A Matrix](https://backtobackswe.com/platform/content/number-of-ways-to-traverse-a-matrix)

```
Given an integer value m (rows of a matrix), and an interger value n (columns of a matrix), return the total possible unique, simple, paths from the top-left of the matrix to the bottom-right with restricted moves.

You may only make one of these moves at each position:
Down 1 cell
Right 1 cell

Example:
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6

Explanation:
s -> "start"
e -> "end"
 -----------
| s | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | _ |
| _ | _ | e |
 -----------

Total unique paths to any given cell:
 -----------
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 1 | 3 | 6 |
 -----------
```

CHECK POINT

Do I understand this/my solution fully?
Can I explain this/my solution to someone else very well?
Is this the most optimal solution asymptotically?
Is this the most optimal solution in terms of real-elapsed time?
Let's sit and ponder. ðŸ¤” Then try more problems.
