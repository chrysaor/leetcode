```
Given a 2D array that resembles the shape of a triangle, return the min-cost path from the top to the bottom.

From each cell, you may only go diagonally down to the left or right.


Example:
Input:
[
  [5],
  [1,6],
  [4,3,10],
  [3,2,4,1]
]

Output: 11
Explanation:
[
      [5],
    [1,  6],
   [4, 3, 10],
  [3, 2, 4, 1]
]

```

CHECK POINT

Do I understand this/my solution fully?
Can I explain this/my solution to someone else very well?
Is this the most optimal solution asymptotically?
Is this the most optimal solution in terms of real-elapsed time?
Let's sit and ponder. ðŸ¤” Then try more problems.
